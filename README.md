# Steps to Machine learning


##### `Disclaimer `
This is my path of learning. Each statement here is near approximation to real ones. As learning directly the real-ones always involves too much depth and i get bored too easily.

I am going by thought that, we need that much knowledge which is neccessary to move to next step and by the time we reach our target through small corrections we will attain most of needed knowledge.

### Intro
This intro can be [skipped](#types), but can add directional sense to the overall path/step.  

Machine learning world assumes that there are only two problems in this whole universe
1. Prediction/Regression problem: Predict something based on past
2. Classification problem: Classify something based on past

Every problem can be directly or indirectly made into these two problems.

##### `End-goal of Artificial Intelligence(AI)`
To develop techniques which enable machine to mimic human behavior.

<a name="scope"/>

##### `Scope`
If Machine can do below then we say its kind-of mimicing human:

Reason, Represent knowledge, Plan, Learn, Process natural language(talk & listen), Perceive, Motion and Manipulation, Extra(Social & general) intelligence

There are many techiques which can make machines do these, one of the most powerful one is "Machine Learning"

##### `Machine Learning`

Idea is that there are generic algorithms that can tell something interesting about a set of data without we having to write any custom code specific to the problem.

In simple words, if we show data to code then it itself finds pattern inside the data(depending on data).
In further simple words, if i show images to code then it itself finds pattern in them and recognizes then dog, cat,....(too ambitious i know :)

### `Types of Learning`
<a name="supervised"/>

##### `Supervised Learning`
I show code the output initially later i will ask what is the output. For example, i will show hell lot of dog and cat pictures and tell which is dog and cat then ask our code at the end to identify a dog or cat based on new picture i show.

Classic examples are
