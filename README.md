# Steps to Machine learning


##### `Most imp note `
Each statement here is near approximation to real ones. As learning directly real-ones always involves too much depth and that can decrease the progress-rate.

I am going by thought that, we need that much knowledge which is neccessary to move to next step and by the time we reach our target through small corrections we will attain most of needed knowledge.

### Intro

<a name="endgoal"/>

##### `End-goal of Artificial Intelligence(AI)`
To develop techniques which enable machine to mimic human behavior.

<a name="scope"/>

##### `Scope`
If Machine can do below then we say its kind-of mimicing human:

Reason, Represent knowledge, Plan, Learn, Process natural language(talk & listen), Perceive, Motion and Manipulation, Extra(Social & general) intelligence

There are many techiques which can make machines do these, one of the most powerful one is "Machine Learning"

##### `Machine Learning`

Idea is that there are generic algorithms that can tell something interesting about a set of data without we having to write any custom code specific to the problem.

In simple words, if we show data to code then it itself finds pattern inside the data(depending on data).
In further simple words, if i show images to code then it itself finds pattern in them and recognizes then dog, cat,....
